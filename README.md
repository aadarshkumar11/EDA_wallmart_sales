## Project Overview
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Walmart's sales data to uncover trends, seasonal patterns, and performance insights. The goal is to identify factors influencing sales performance across different stores and departments, as well as to provide actionable insights for optimization.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data analysis and visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive analysis and experimentation.
- **Libraries**: pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project includes the following fields:
- Weekly Sales
- Store ID
- Department ID
- Holiday Indicators
- Date

The dataset was sourced from Kaggleâ€™s open data platform and can be found in the `data` folder of this repository.

## Key Features
1. **Data Cleaning**: Address missing values, handle outliers, and ensure consistent data formatting.
2. **Trend Analysis**: Identify patterns in sales performance across time and holidays.
3. **Store and Department Analysis**: Compare sales across different stores and departments to identify key contributors.
4. **Visualization**: Generate clear, informative charts using Python for insights.

## Methodology
The project follows these steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data to handle missing values and inconsistent formats.
2. **EDA**: Analyze data distributions, seasonal patterns, and correlations.
3. **Performance Comparison**: Evaluate store- and department-wise performance.
4. **Holiday Impact Analysis**: Assess how holidays affect sales performance.
5. **Visualization**: Create various plots to summarize findings interactively.

## Results and Insights
- **Seasonal Trends**: Significant sales spikes were observed during holidays such as Thanksgiving and Christmas.
- **Top Performers**: Certain stores and departments consistently outperformed others, indicating potential best practices.
- **Holiday Impact**: Holidays drive major sales, emphasizing the need for targeted planning.
- **Correlations**: Larger stores generally achieve higher sales, suggesting the importance of infrastructure.
